# Experiments
A collection of random mini side-projects for continual learning :)

## Contents
1. `constraints` - My ramblings around how existing optimization packages over-complicate interfaces with code-bases and limit quick experimentation/iteration. I propose a way of fixing things (not that anyone will listen :wink: ).
2. `gaussian_processes` - My way of learning pytorch + understanding the speed-up associated with vectorizing kernel computation in vanilla Gaussian Processes.
